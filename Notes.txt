this makes the database. "-p" tells ef which project to get entities from. "-o" is the output folder for our migration. 
I think "-s" is for solution.

	dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate -p Infrastructure -s API -o Data/Migrations

This is how you remove a migration

	dotnet ef migrations remove -p Infrastructure -s API 

This makes the database
	database update
